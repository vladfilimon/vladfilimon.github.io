title: ERC20 Short Attack
---
> On: Security, Solidity, Smart Contracts, EVM

This Underflow attack is a very interesting one as it relies on a couple of things, like improper input sanitation, Ethereum not implementing checksum on addresses, and finally the way the EVM packs together the method call and the arguments.
The attacker has to control an address ending with a trailing 0. He would then use this address, without the last 0 (truncate the end byte), as an input address argument while interacting with a smart contract.

Checksums have never been implemented on Ethereum addresses, this was by design, as users were only supposed to use nameregs and not supply direct hexadecimal eth addresses. This felt like a failure on ETH's behalf for most of the comunity, as almost all the
other blockchains (starting with Bitcoin) had addresses with checksum at the end.
